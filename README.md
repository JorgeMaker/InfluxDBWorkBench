# - InfluxDB WorkBench - 

**InfluxDB WorkBench is a GUI management tool for [the InfluxDB time series database](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) 
written in Java that runs on Windows , Mac OS X and Unix/Linux, etc**
InfluxDB WorkBench is an application coping the functionality of [InfluxDB Studio](https://github.com/CymaticLabs/InfluxDBStudio) which can only 
be run on Windows, but written in java and therefore you can run it any platform.

The following are planned features implemented by [InfluxDB Studio](https://github.com/CymaticLabs/InfluxDBStudio) that are not yet implemented in 
the current version of InfluxDB WorkBench:

* Refresh
* Show Users
* Show Statics
* Show Diagnostics
* Show Queries
* Show Continuous Queries
* Run Back Fill

You can download an executable filfe for [Windows](https://github.com/JorgeMaker/InfluxDBWorkBench/releases/download/1.0/InfluxDBWorkBench.exe) ,  [Mac OS X](https://github.com/JorgeMaker/InfluxDBWorkBench/releases/download/1.0/InfluxDBWorkBench.app.zip), or an executable [Jar file](https://github.com/JorgeMaker/InfluxDBWorkBench/releases/download/1.0/influxDBWorkBench.jar) to run anywhere.You jut need having installed JRE 1.7 or higher. You just need download a the executable filfe and store it in a folder where you have  write permissions.  

Because Influx WorkBench copies the functionality of Influx Studio works exactly the same. You can consult the user guide found [here](https://github.com/CymaticLabs/InfluxDBStudio/blob/master/README.md)
